    <h2>About the Data Visualization</h2>

    <section>
        <p>
            This project showcases an interactive data visualization exploring how wildfires in California have evolved over time, 
            and how they correlate with environmental factors like drought, temperature, and population density. 
            The goal of this project is to provide insight into tackling current wildfires and preventing those in the future.

            Our intended audience includes environmental and disaster prevention organizations (ex. CalFire, LA County Fire Department etc.), 
            emergency response teams trying to predict and respond to wildfires more effectively, and climate scientists studying fire and the effects on climate.
      
            Data Source: U.S. Forest Service's Fire Program Analysis Fire-Occurrence Database (FPA-FOD).
